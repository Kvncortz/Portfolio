# Portfolio

Hi there, I'm Kevin Cortez ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm a Project Manager based in the New York Metro Area. I believe that software development is not just about writing code; 
it's about solving real-world problems and making people's lives easier. 
That's why I had made it a goal to build software solutions that have a meaningful impact on people's lives. 
Here you'll find a few projects that showcase my skills and experience.

Projects:
Dynamic Link List
This project demonstrates my understanding of data structures and algorithms. 
I implemented a dynamic link list in C++ and wrote unit tests to ensure the correctness of the code. 
This project was a great learning experience, and I enjoyed working on it.

Stacks
In this project, I implemented a stack data structure in C++. 
This project was inspired by my interest in system programming and my desire to learn more about data structures. 


Inventory Management Program
This project was my attempt at building a real-world application. 
I created an inventory management system that allows users to add, modify, and delete items from their inventory. 
This project helped me understand how to use databases.
