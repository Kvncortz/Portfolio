"""Create a number guessing game where:

The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 50.
The user has to guess the number.
If the guess is too high or too low, the program provides a hint.
The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.
After the user guesses correctly, the program asks if they want to play again.
Features to include:

Use a while loop to keep the game running until the user guesses correctly.
Use an if statement to compare the userâ€™s guess to the correct number and provide feedback.
Use another while loop after the game finishes to ask if the user wants to play again."""
