"""Create a Simple Calculator Program

Write a program that allows the user to:

Choose a mathematical operation: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, or Division.
Input two numbers for the chosen operation.
Perform the calculation and display the result.
After displaying the result, ask if the user wants to perform another calculation. If yes, loop back to the start; if no, exit the program.
The program should keep running until the user decides to quit.

This will give you more practice with if statements and while loops, along with basic arithmetic!"""
